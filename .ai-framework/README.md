# AI Collaboration Framework - Simple Edition

**Philosophy:** Simple is better.

---

## What This Is

A minimal framework for AI collaboration using file-based communication.

**Core Files:**
- `BOARD.md` - Current status
- `TASKS.md` - Task list

**That's it.**

---

## Commands

- `/check-the-board` - Read BOARD.md and TASKS.md
- `/fix-violations` - Fix reported issues
- `/works-ready` - Validate and merge
- `/merge-to-main` - Create PR

All commands are simple. No scripts, no complexity.

---

## Workflow

1. **Check status** - Read BOARD.md
2. **Do work** - Make changes
3. **Commit** - Save changes
4. **Push** - Upload to GitHub
5. **Merge** - Create PR and merge

Simple git workflow. No bureaucracy.

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ No proof-of-completion systems
- ❌ No caching layers
- ❌ No monitoring/enforcement
- ❌ No natural language parsers
- ❌ No complex state tracking
- ❌ No excessive documentation

---

## Design Principles

1. **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
2. **Files over scripts** - Read markdown, not JSON
3. **Trust over verify** - If it works, it's done
4. **Clarity over automation** - Simple beats clever
5. **Minimal over comprehensive** - Less is more

**If you find yourself adding complexity, you're doing it wrong.**
